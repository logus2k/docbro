# Overview

CRISP-ML(Q), an enhanced process model designed to guide the development and quality assurance of machine learning applications. While traditional frameworks like CRISP-DM focus on static data mining, this new methodology addresses the specific risks of model degradation and technical debt by adding a dedicated monitoring and maintenance phase. The authors merge business and data understanding into a single initial step, emphasizing that project feasibility depends heavily on data availability and measurable success criteria.

Throughout the lifecycle, the model suggests technical quality assurance methods to mitigate risks related to data preparation, model training, and deployment. These practices ensure that machine learning systems remain robust, explainable, and reproducible when integrated into real-world industrial products.

Ultimately, the framework aims to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial reliability by providing a standardized roadmap for practitioners.

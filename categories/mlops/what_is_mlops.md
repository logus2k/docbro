# What is MLOps

In the lab, Machine Learning feels like magic. You feed a model some data, tune a few hyperparameters, and watch the accuracy climb. But in the real world? **A model is only as good as the system that supports it.**

Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they're data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next.

Most ML projects fail not because the code is bad, but because the 'plumbing' is missing. **MLOps**, or Machine Learning Operations, is the bridge between building a model and actually running a business on it. It’s the fusion of Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and DevOps.

While traditional DevOps focuses on code versions, MLOps has to juggle three moving targets:

1. **The Code** (The algorithms)
2. **The Data** (The fuel)
3. **The Model** (The artifact)

If any one of these shifts, the whole system can break. Today, we aren't just talking about how to train a model, we’re talking about how to design a system that survives the wild.

# Gymnasium Overview

**Gymnasium** is an open-source library that provides a **standardized interface** for reinforcement learning research, serving as the actively maintained successor to **OpenAI Gym**. The toolkit addresses the lack of consistency in the field by offering a **unified API** that allows different training algorithms and environments to work together seamlessly. It features a diverse collection of **built-in environments**, ranging from simple physics simulations to complex robotic tasks, alongside new **algebraic spaces** for multi-modal data.

Key innovations include a **functional environment API** for hardware acceleration and a clear distinction between **episodic termination and truncation** to improve algorithmic accuracy. By supporting **vectorized environments**, Gymnasium enables researchers to run thousands of simulations in parallel, significantly increasing computational efficiency.

Ultimately, the library aims to **streamline AI development** by providing robust tools for reproducibility and innovation.
